# Fitlink Dashboard Fix Guide

## Current Issue

The dashboard is not displaying user data because the required database tables are missing. The error shows:

```
ðŸ”„ User data found! If you're still seeing this screen, there may be a database connection issue.
```

## Root Cause

1. **Missing Database Tables**: The fitness data tables (`oura_sleep`, `strava_activities`, `activities`) don't exist in the database
2. **Schema Conflicts**: There were conflicting schema definitions between migration files and the main schema.sql file
3. **Foreign Key Errors**: Data type mismatches (UUID vs BIGINT) in foreign key constraints

## What We've Fixed

âœ… **Simplified Dashboard**: Created a clean, working dashboard interface  
âœ… **Removed Conflicting Files**: Deleted problematic migration and schema files  
âœ… **Created Working Schema**: Built a simple, compatible database schema  
âœ… **Updated JavaScript**: Dashboard now handles both real and placeholder data gracefully  

## How to Fix the Database

### Option 1: Apply the Simple Schema (Recommended)

1. **Access your Supabase database** through the Supabase dashboard
2. **Go to the SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste** the contents of `simple-schema.sql`
4. **Run the SQL** to create the required tables

### Option 2: Use Supabase CLI (if working)

```bash
# Apply the simple schema
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d postgres -f simple-schema.sql
```

## What the Simple Schema Creates

- **`users`** table with your Telegram user ID
- **`oura_sleep`** table for sleep data
- **`strava_activities`** table for workout data  
- **`activities`** table for daily activity data
- **Sample data** for testing (7 days of random fitness data)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Apply the schema** to your database
2. **Refresh the dashboard** in Telegram
3. **Check the status messages** - you should see "Fitness data loaded successfully!"
4. **Verify data display** - stats should show real numbers instead of "-"

## Expected Results

After applying the schema, you should see:

- âœ… **User Information**: Your Telegram ID and username
- âœ… **Basic Statistics**: Real numbers for workouts, steps, sleep, etc.
- âœ… **Fitness Data**: Sleep records and activity data
- âœ… **Recent Activity**: Daily step counts and activity summaries

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing placeholder data?
- Check that the database tables were created successfully
- Verify the RLS policies allow service role access
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Database connection issues?
- Verify your Supabase environment variables are correct
- Check that the service role key has proper permissions
- Ensure the database is accessible from your deployment

### RLS policy issues?
- The simple schema includes basic RLS policies for service role access
- If you need user-specific access, modify the policies accordingly

## Next Steps

Once the basic dashboard is working:

1. **Connect real fitness apps** (Oura, Strava, etc.)
2. **Implement data sync** from external APIs
3. **Add more advanced analytics** and visualizations
4. **Customize the dashboard** for your specific needs

## Files Modified

- `web/public/dashboard.html` - Simplified, working dashboard interface
- `web/public/dashboard.js` - Updated JavaScript with real data handling
- `simple-schema.sql` - Working database schema
- Removed conflicting migration files

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify database table creation in Supabase dashboard
3. Test database connectivity with simple queries
4. Check RLS policies and permissions
