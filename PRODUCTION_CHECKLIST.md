## Quick Health Check Commands

```bash
# Test bot API
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot{BOT_TOKEN}/getMe"

# Test webhook endpoint
curl "https://{PROJECT_REF}.supabase.co/functions/v1/telegram/health"

# Test database connection
# (Run in Supabase SQL editor)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

## Emergency Procedures

**If bot stops responding:**
1. Check Supabase function logs
2. Verify webhook is still set: `/getWebhookInfo`
3. Redeploy functions if needed
4. Check API quotas (Anthropic, Oura, Strava)

**If OAuth fails:**
1. Verify redirect URIs in provider settings
2. Check environment variables in Supabase
3. Test OAuth URLs manually
4. Review function logs for errors

**If AI not working:**
1. Check Anthropic API key and credits
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test with simple health question
4. Review Claude API logs
