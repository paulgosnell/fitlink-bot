# 🧠 Fitlink Bot - Smart AI Integration

## 💡 Problem Solved: Efficient Claude AI Usage

**Issue**: Using AI for every message = expensive + slow  
**Solution**: Smart detection + conversation state management

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Keyword Detection**
- Monitors for health-related terms: `sleep`, `tired`, `workout`, `training`, etc.
- Only triggers AI suggestion when relevant
- Saves Claude API calls for non-health messages

### 2. **Conversation States**
```
Regular Chat → Health Keywords Detected → Offer AI Help → AI Mode → Follow-up Questions
```

### 3. **Three Trigger Methods**

**A) Smart Detection**
```
User: "I'm feeling tired today"
Bot: "I noticed you mentioned feeling tired! 🏃‍♂️ 
     Would you like me to analyze your data and provide advice?"
     [🧠 Yes, get AI advice] [📊 Daily briefing instead]
```

**B) Direct Button**
```
User: (any message)
Bot: "Hi! I'm your Fitlink Bot..."
     [🧠 Ask Health Question] [📊 Daily Briefing]
```

**C) Commands**
```
/briefing - AI-generated daily summary
/start - Shows main menu with AI options
```

### 4. **Conversation State Management**
- `awaiting_health_question` - User in Q&A mode
- Timeout after 10 minutes to prevent stuck states
- Clear end session option

## 🚀 Cost Optimization

**Before**: Every message → Claude API call  
**After**: Only health-related conversations use AI

**Estimated savings**: 80-90% reduction in API calls

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

1. **Regular message** → Simple response + buttons
2. **Health keywords** → Smart suggestion + options  
3. **Button press** → Activate AI mode
4. **Q&A session** → Multiple questions allowed
5. **Session end** → Return to normal mode
